#rendering-engine

Hey everyone! Sorry for not updating, but I'm working on a rendering engine written entirely on C! No other libraries were used apart from SDL3 and GLAD. I might one day make a custom OpenGL loader but that seems a bit too overkill. As of writing this, I'm currently working on orthographic projection for my camera structure.

I'm thinking of adding a render queue for my renderer soon.

My idea for a renderer queue came to my mind years ago when I started learning OpenGL, but I never really implemented it because that means I would have to write my own engine. But now that I'm making one. It's a great time to implement it next, after fully implementing rendering of basic shapes like quads, triangles, custom models, and lines.

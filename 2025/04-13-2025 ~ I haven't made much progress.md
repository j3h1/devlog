#game-engine-dev 

I'm pretty busy with.. life. Which is why I haven't made a devlog for a couple of weeks. I might try rewriting/refactoring my code because of how messy it is. I'm not quite satisfied with the organization of the code, and it makes a factor for slowing down development.

You'll see me rewrite code quite often. I'm always not satisfied with how I write code. Especially when I actually start writing code I focus more on it working more than organizing it first which hurts me in the long run because it makes it hard for my future self to know how any of the code works.

#cell-machine-clone 

I'm working on a Cell Machine clone. I have been trying to do this since 2023 and I remain unsuccessful with my attempts. I feel like this is actually the time that I get the motivation to actually work on this. I'm currently working on the simulation code before anything else, because that's the most important part of Cell Machine.

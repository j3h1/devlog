Welcome to my devlog! I hope you have a nice time reading these. I do these everytime I work on my projects, starting from March 30, 2025.

Also It's recommended to view this in [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). Which is what this devlog was written on. I don't have enough money to get Obsidian Publish, so this is the best I could do.

### How do I view this in obsidian.md?
You first need [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). Then to start reading, clone this repository, And open the folder as your vault in obsidian. If you want to be updated without having to clone over and over, you could do a `git pull` command to update every changes, or you could install the Git extension and pull from there. To install it's either in the community plugins menu in obsidian or by installing it manually from [this repo](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git).

### Great! How do I support you?
You can buy me a coffee at kofi

#game-engine-dev 

I wouldn't really call it "refactoring" but close enough.

This is my first devlog, but I've already progressed in my engine. Still, it's pretty bare bones. Just today, I kinda organized my files. Now it looks like a java project because of how nested the files are.

If you're wondering what it looks like, here is a tree of it.
